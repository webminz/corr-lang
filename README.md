# CorrLang 

CorrLang is a tool/library that helps you with several model and system integration tasks.
It is based on a DSL with the same name.
In this DSL you specify structural relations between schemas of different endpoints. 

## Get Started

If you are just interested in running CorrLang, the easiest would be to [download the compiled binaries](https://github.com/webminz/corr-lang/releases/download/v0.9/corrlang-0.9.zip)
and follow the [tutorial](https://www.corrlang.io/tutorialWS/).
If you are more inclined to building that same version yourself, have a look at the [release branch](https://github.com/webminz/corr-lang/tree/releases).
Otherwise, if you want to have a look at the current state of the development, you mau check out the [dev branch](https://github.com/webminz/corr-lang/tree/dev) (But beware: It is bit unstable there at the moment...).
