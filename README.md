CorrLang is a tool/library that helps you with several model and system integration tasks.
It is based on a DSL with the same name.
In this DSL you specify structural relations between schemas of different endpoints. 

## Status

You are currently watching the development branch! 
It is in the middle of a major refactoring/restructuring and many things are not as they should be, yet!
Please stay tuned for further updates.
