#    ${workdir} --> Contains the current working directory from where you called CorrLang
#    ${config} --> Contains the path to this configuration file
#    ${configdir} --> Contains the path to the directory that contains this file
# ${appname}, ${jvm}, ${config} and ${configdir} cannot be overwritten, but ${workdir} can. See below...
